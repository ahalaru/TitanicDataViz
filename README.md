The sinking of the RMS Titanic in her maiden voyage is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The Titanic dataset has information about 891 people, giving some basic information about them viz.their Age, Sex, Class ,the fare they paid and most importantly if they survived the disaster or no. In this visualization I  represented the counts of people survived (1) and not survived (0) across age groups and further classified each Age group across Sex and Class.
